      <p className="mb-3">In May of 2024, I'm graduating from KYH (Higher Vocational Education) where I've spent two years studying to become a
        <span className="font-medium">Front End Developer</span>. Before starting my education, I had a long career in healthcare as a personal assistant and nursing assistant.
        I also ran my own business, operating an e-commerce store specializing in clothing and shoes for women. &ensp;

        <span>One of the things I</span>
        <span className="font-medium">love</span>
        <span>most about programming is the ability to bring various projects to life and witness them in action on the screen.</span>
        I have experience with
        <span className="font-medium">
          Html, Css, Javascript, Typescript, React, Next.js, TailwindCss, Node.js and MongoDB</span> for mentioned a few.
        &ensp;I've explored UX/UI design using Figma.
        &ensp;
        <span>I have gained practical experience through a recent internship. In this role, I worked on UX design, front-end and back-end development for a CMS handling job advertisements and applications, as well as a career page. </span>
        &ensp;
        I enjoy the diversity of the work and the fact that I am always learning something new. My goal is to become a full-stack developer in the future.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span> As a person, I'm known for my social personality, dedication, empathy, and collaborative spirit. I thrive in team environments and always strive to create a positive atmosphere while delivering exceptional results to my clients.</span>
        <span className="font-medium"> I am currently looking for a  full-time position</span> as a Front-end
        developer in Stockholm. Or hybrid/remote work, I would love to work in a company where I can grow and learn from other developers, and contribute to the success of a diverse team.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, you'll find me either hitting the gym, or unwinding with a game of Mario Kart.
        And ofcourse spending quality time with my family.
